# Making text glow in Google Slides

***I know the text says, "HELL", but it actually says, "HELLO!". Don't question about that please :-(***

### Step 1Ô∏è‚É£:
To get started, you have to open format options on a text...

(You can open format options by right-clicking, and click on "Format options".
Or you can click on the text (but don't go to type state) and then go to the "Format" tab. You'll then find "Format options".)


`Right-click way` üñ±Ô∏è

` Format tab way`

### Step 2Ô∏è‚É£:
While at format options, click on "Drop shadow".

### Step 3Ô∏è‚É£:
Set the drop shadow options to look like these:

(You should make `Angle` to `0`, `Distance` to `0`, and `Blur Radius` to where it shows it's glowing.
If it doesn't show up well, try making `Transparency` to below `20%`.)

(You should **NOT** make the `Blur Radius` to any percentage below `10%`, because
it'll become unable to see the glow to the text!)

(You should *also* **NOT** make the `Blur Radius` to a percentage above `30%`, because
it'll become too blury-looking and it can cause your style to become a mess. ~Probably not, though...~)

You should also change the glow (or drop shadow) color to any color you want.

I'd recommend to do the text's color. ‚úîÔ∏è
